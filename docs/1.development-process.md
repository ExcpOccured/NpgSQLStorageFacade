Development Process
===================

Repository Management
---------------------

NpgSQLStorageFacade is being developed in accordance to the tailored [GitHub
Flow][github-flow] process.

For small bug fixes and features, it means creating a GitHub pull request that
will get merged into the main branch. The only difference with the GitHub flow
proposed in the documentation is that the maintainers will do their best to
perform, in that order:

1. Fast-forward pull request merge, if possible
2. Rebase, if not very hard
3. Proper merge with creating a merge commit otherwise

This helps to keep the repository history clean without creating any unnecessary
complications.

When encountering a bug or a feature absence, try the following, in that order:

1. For really simple fixes, you may just go ahead and create a pull request
   without any additional bureaucracy required
2. For moderate problems and small absent features, always remember to create an
   issue first: it will allow you to discuss details of the bug/feature with
   other project users and maintainers before writing a patch
3. For huge, fundamental features create an RFC (see the next section of this
   document)

Request For Comments
--------------------

In NpgSQLStorageFacade, we aim to manage the project tasks efficiently and carefully,
which means that:

- every feature status should be clear (either it is planned, is it in
  discussion, or is it implemented)
- every big and/or important feature should be documented
- every big feature deserves to be discussed by maintainers and other interested
  persons before being included into the project
